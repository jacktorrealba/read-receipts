Read Receipts  

## What is Read-Receipts?

Read-Receipts is a website I built that web scrapes [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) for the last 12 months of user and book data in order to output a persona classification based on your reading habits.

## Instructions 

1. Navigate to your Goodreads profile and copy the url. It should look like: 
    ```https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/123456789-YOUR_USERNAME```
2. Modify the url so it does not contain your username. It should now look like:
    ```https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/123456789```
3. Copy the modified url and paste into the input and click the arrow button to submit. 
4. Once it has completed, you should see a "Download PNG" button where you can download the image of your reading persona classifications.
